# Siri Shortcuts for Open WebUI and Ollama
Siri Shortcuts you can use to communicate with a local AI via apps like [Ollama](https://ollama.com) and [Open WebUI](https://openwebui.com). Two options, one feeds through Open WebUI proxy to Ollama, and one will connect directly with Ollama.

### Open WebUI API Siri Shortcut

You will need the *Open WebUI URL*, the *LLM Model ID*, and the user *API key*. The shortcut will prompt you for that information upon installation.

### Ollama only Siri Shortcut

You will need the *Ollama URL* (localhost) and the *LLM Model ID*. The shortcut will prompt you for that information upon installation.

Note: If you are wanting to access Ollama remotely via iPhone/iPad, then use the OpenWebUI shortcut. The "Ollama only" solution will really only work via "localhost" on a Mac, and cannot be access by a remote device unless you expose the Ollama port, but for general security, I would recommend just using OpenWebUI with an API key.
